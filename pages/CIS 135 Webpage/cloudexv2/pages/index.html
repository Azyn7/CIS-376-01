										my wife, and computer technology. So, here's a list of unique things about me!

						<li>I enjoy a good variety of music! From Japanese Music to some Heavy Rock, I love all kinds. My favorite songs are a variety of genres, but include songs like 
						<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDpOcp98b5k" target="_blank" id="indexLink">[Forever After All]</a></b>, 
						<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8r29b1KYoc" target="_blank" id="indexLink">[Dancing With the Devil]</a></b>,
						<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq09UkPRdFY" target="_blank" id="indexLink">[Fantasy]</a></b>,
						<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9owz_fa5Bc4" target="_blank" id="indexLink">[We'll Meet Again]</a></b> (I <b>LOVE</b> the Ink Spots),
						<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh9yZWeTmVM" target="_blank" id="indexLink">[The Beginning]</a></b> (by my favorite Japanese band). So, as you can see, my music tase is rather diverse. And below is my favorite playlist!

							I <b>ADORE</b> video games. I got my first console <i>(the Playstation 2)</i> for my first Christmas <i>(2004)</i>. I didn't get to use it then, obviously, as my parents bought it for themselves until I got older; however, once
							I was able to think and comprehend, I was hooked. Some of my first games were Star Wars: Battlefront I and II, Kingdom Hearts II, the Simpsons: Hit and Run, and a variety of lego games. This started me down a path that of which
							technology was heavily rooted. I got my first laptop in 2011 and my first desktop in 2012. Once I found out about Minecraft (part of the reason I got a laptop), I was hooked. It as well as Garry's Mod, and a variety of Source Engine
							games, were the first PC games I ever owned. My favorite games include Final Fantasy 7 (and the Remake), NeiR: Automata, and Code Vein.
						</li></br>
						<li>
							I've been coding for a while (since at least 7th grade)! It's never been anything to serious, though. I knew it's what I wanted to do with my life however. I dabbled in HTML, CSS, C++, gLua, Lua, Java, JavaScript, Python,
							and a few other languages (literally nothing more than the basics. I didn't know any of the syntax or anything.) The first time I legitimately learned code

						<p>Hello There! I'm <b>Ryan McDonald!</b> I'm a freshman IT major at the University of North Alabama. So far, I'm absolutely loving it (as you can see by the time spent making this site <i>(approx. 2 days and
						3 redesigns and re-codes)</i>. As you can see by the title, <b>CloudEX</b>, and the character at the top right of the screen, I'm quite the fan of video games <i>(with Final Fantasy 7 being my favorite one of them
						all)</i>! I'll have more information in <b>[Projects]</b> as well as <b>[Videos]</b> relating to gaming and coding as a whole, but I do want to introduce myself a little here!</br></br></br> 
						As I stated, I'm an IT major and I love video games. This obsession <i>(and possible future career of mine)</i> was caused by my late-father. He introduced me to all things technology from a young age; and, you can
						see the bi-product of that before you today. I've been modding games since I was about 10, which is 3 years after my Father passed, and have been working on various youtube channels as a creator and editor
						since 2014. I've had various, some cringy and some not, names as well as a variety of content underneath my name <i>(from essay videos to funny moments and commentaries)</i>. All of this technical know-how was made
						possible through the sheer amount of time I spent on my computer, as well as my doting and intelligent Father. He planted the seeds of what would later become a giant tree.</br></br></br> 
						As you can see on the right, I'm married <i>(and I'm only 18!)</i> I've been with my darling wife since right after my dad passed in 3rd grade, and we've been together ever since. We got engaged in late 2020 and married
						just a handful of months ago. She cheers me up when I'm down, cures me when I'm sick, and makes a great mage in Diablo for supporting me from the backline <i>(just kidding, usually she's the one running ahead
						into fights way over her head)</i>. She's almost like a chihuahua. She's tiny and adorable, but very, very ferocious. She makes every day in my life brighter, and is the one that keeps pushing me towards following
						my dreams of being a software developer despite the idea stuck in my head that I'm incapabale of doing so. In short: she is my <b>everything</b>.</p>
