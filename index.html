                    already tell, if you aren't a game freak, this page is inspired by one of my favorite games,
                    Cyberpunk 2077.

                    eventually become like a family to me, was the L4D2 Beta Pack team, now branded
                    as Sourcerer. I would go on to become the Assistant Lead for the project, second in command
                    to Gigan, otherwise known as Peter; however, after restructuring, and a swap in roles, I
                    became the lead Graphic Designer. The project has now essentially reached completion,
                    and its project statement met. I did attribute a handful of script mods to tck; however,
                    the majority of my work was graphic work, hence the new role.
