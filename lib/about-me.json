        "content": "From my earliest memories, I had always had an obsession with technology, primarily imposed onto me by my late Father, who was a huge nerd and inspiration for my eventual career path, even though he had nothing to do with it himself. <br><br> My earliest foray into the realm of computer science was probably my time with Half-Life 2, or, more specifically, a mod turned game for it called Garry's Mod, in the early 2010s, around the age of 10-12. It ran on a reconstructed / highly edited version of Lua very creatively named gLua. While I never learned it much indepth, this was where I began to form the basics of software development with miniscule scripts to create weapons, which taught me valuable information early on such as file structure, naming conventions, data types, and other programming basics. <br><br> I had been a developer for many servers inside the community of the game, although primarily friend owned, for the creation of scripts for the server, primarily related to the gamemode 'DarkRP' within the game, and its various functions. I learned quite a bit about version control systems and FTP services, as well as website development for the servers communities.<br><br>While it was nothing truly indepth or mind blowing, it laid heavy groundworks for my future, and lead to an advantage in my senior year of high school where, in my first ever computer science / programming course, I was forced to catch up on six months worth of Java study in a week whenever I went virtual. Not only did I catch up in a week, I finished the course in two, and had a solid understanding of Java by the end of it. I haven't used it in a while, so the syntax is hazy, but it lead to a much easier time understanding C++ in my most recent computer science classes.<br><br>In essence, I was closer to a \"script kiddie\" than a \"programmer\"; however, a start is a start.
